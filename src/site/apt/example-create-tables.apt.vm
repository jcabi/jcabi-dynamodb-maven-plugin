Create Tables Before Integration Tests

  In most cases you will need tables pre-created
  in DynamoDB Local, which your integration tests will use.
  You can use <<<create-tables>>> goal:

+--
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-dynamodb-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <tables>
      <table>${sign}{basedir}/first.json</table>
      <table>${sign}{basedir}/second.json</table>
    </tables>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>start</goal>
        <goal>create-tables</goal>
        <goal>stop</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
+--

  JSON file should have the following format
  (according to AWS specification of
  {{{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTable.html}<<<createTable>>>}}):

+--
{
  "AttributeDefinitions": [
    {
      "AttributeName": "first",
      "AttributeType": "S"
    }
  ],
  "KeySchema": [
    {
      "AttributeName": "first",
      "KeyType": "HASH"
    }
  ],
  "ProvisionedThroughput": {
    "ReadCapacityUnits": "100",
    "WriteCapacityUnits": "100"
  },
  "TableName": "FirstTable"
}
+--
