DynamoDB Maven Plugin

  AWS recently announced a tool,
  {{{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.html}DynamoDB Local}},
  for testing applications based on DynamoDB. The tool is a standalone
  Java application, shipped by Amazon in form of a <<<tar.gz>>> archive. Inside
  the archive there is a JAR file and a collection of supplementary
  shared libraries for different platforms.

  The tool starts as a standalone web server and responds to AWS SDK requests
  through HTTP RESTful API similar to the one provided by DynamoDB. It's
  a very handy instrument for unit testing, but it needs additional wrapping
  in order to become useful in Maven builds.

  In Maven build, we want this fake DynamoDB server to start automatically,
  right before JUnit runs all unit/integration tests. And we want to shut it
  down right after the tests are finished.

  This plugin does exactly that, by starting DynamoDB Local
  in <<<pre-integration-test>>> phase and shutting it down
  in <<<post-integration-test>>>.

  {{{./usage.html}Usage}} page explains how to get it up and running.

  The plugin was tested with Maven 3.0.5 and 3.1.0 on:

   * Mac OS X 10.8.5

   * Windows 7 SP 1

   * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Desktop

  If you use it somewhere else and it works for you, please let us know
  and we'll add your platform to this list.
  If you have problems or suggestions, please submit them as issues to
  {{{http://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-dynamodb-maven-plugin/issues}Github}}.
